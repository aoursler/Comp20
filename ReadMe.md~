1. What is this purpose of this Git repository?
   The purpose of this repositiory is two-fold. Most simply it is a place 
   to put work from comp20 for submission and grading. This means that it 
   becomes a portfolio of our work throught this semester of comp 20. 
   Additionaly this repository was an oportunity to become competant and 
   confident in the usage of git and github, usefull tools for coding in 
   the future.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
   My personal favorite lab assignment is supprisingly enough still the 
   personal website at the begining of the semester. It was one of the 
   first times I saw my work turn into something that looked even 
   remotely good. In additon I have continued to go back to thinking 
   about it over the semester and have a plan to redo it over winter 
   break and create a better website and portfolio.

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
   Alot. I have learned so much about front end developement and how the
   world around me works. This course has taught me so much about the 
   internet, and given me a much stronger foundation on my ability to 
   continue learning outside of class.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? 
   Cite two examples as evidence.
   One of the bigest things I learned was how to effectivly google things, and thus teach myself. Mongo was huge on this front. I didn't get alot of how to use Mongo from lecture, and to be completely honest, the documentation for MongoDB sucks. In additon I have learned html, javascript, and a huge respect for designers who make astheticaly beautiful work.

Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
Security. I don't think I ever got a great hold on it. Sure I could find a few flaws in a very flawed product, but I know there were far more things beneth the surface. I will definitly be taking security in the future to follow up on this. In addition I would really like to get more experince making websites as I feel like I have just scraped the surface of what is possible.
